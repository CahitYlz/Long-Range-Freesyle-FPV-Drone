# Long Range & Freestyle FPV Drone

## Mission
This project focuses on designing and building an FPV drone that balances long-range efficiency with freestyle performance.
The primary objective is to understand and optimize the engineering trade-offs between flight time, agility, durability, and overall system efficiency.

Rather than targeting extreme speed or pure long-range configurations, the goal is to develop a well-balanced, reliable platform that can be improved through testing, iteration, and data-driven decisions.

## Project Goals
- Balance long-range flight efficiency with freestyle maneuverability
- Optimize weight and thrust-to-weight ratio
- Compare power systems and battery voltages (4S vs 5S)
- Maintain a modular, upgrade-friendly system architecture
- Learn through real-world testing and documented iteration
